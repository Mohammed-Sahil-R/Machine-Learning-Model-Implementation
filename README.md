## Objective:
To implement a complete predictive Machine Learning (ML) pipeline using the **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** framework, covering data preparation, model training, and rigorous performance evaluation.

## Project Environment and Data Handling:
The entire project workflow is contained and documented within a **Jupyter Notebook**. A classification dataset (e.g., for spam detection or a standard public dataset) is used to simulate a real-world predictive scenario.
* **Data Splitting**: Data is crucialy split into training and testing subsets using `train_test_split` (typically 70% train, 30% test) to ensure the model's ability to generalize on unseen data.

## Model Training:
A robust classification algorithm, such as **Logistic Regression** or **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, is selected from the `sklearn` modules. The model is instantiated and trained using the training data via the standard `.fit()` method.

## Model Evaluation and Results:
Model performance is assessed on the test set. Key evaluation metrics include:
* **Accuracy Score**: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
* **Classification Report**: This detailed report provides per-class metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**, which are essential for understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses for each class.

The notebook includes a small section demonstrating the model making a prediction on a new, single data point. The final deliverable is the **Jupyter Notebook**, showcasing the full implementation and evaluation results.
